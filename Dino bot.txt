Google offline dino game bot ============>

REQUIRED LIBRARIES:-
pip install pyautogui
pip install numpy
pip install pillow

Edit the box tupple in imagegrab() function and change its coordinates according to your screen
the coordinates are (x1,y1 and x2,y2)
also with your screen resolution and change in coordinates, different a.sum() value will come so also change it afterwards

Working: imagegrab() function keeps on taking the image of the coordinates given and change it to a grayscale image then make array out of it
so normally the image is all white in front of dinosaur so same array sum will generate
if any obstacles come then array sum will change and then jump function will be called 
by pyautogui library space key will be pressed automatically
